# Introduction
Wordle is more fun when you can cheat (just a little!) using this companion app when you play online, or play stand-alone. The app uses an information-theoretic approach to solving for the optimized list of best guesses to choose from at every turn using the expected value (Shannon's entropy) computed for each word in the dictionary and measured in bits. See 3Blue1Brown's Youtube video for an excellent discussion of the subject.

It would be be boring if you cheated at every turn so don't! Play against any Wordle site  and have a peek at the top guesses only when you're really stumped.  It's fun to see how far you can get without a 'cheat' and a relief to know you can when you want to. You can also play with different word size: 4-8 char lengths are supported, you can build more with the included files.

# Usage
